# How to Install Ruscord

## Please read before starting

> \[!WARNING]
> We have detected that Ruscord might not start due to GTK issues,
> as it tries to run different versions of `GTK2/3 and GTK4` simultaneously.
> In this case, it is recommended to follow the Tip section.

> \[!CAUTION]
> Ruscord might not open properly, so check the logs by opening a terminal and typing
> `/opt/Ruscord/ruscord` or `ruscord`.
> If you see no errors, Ruscord may just be slow to start â€” please wait a bit.
> If you do see errors, report them to [Github issues](https://github.com/dvytvs/Ruscord-linux-version/issues).

> \[!TIP]
> If you encounter compatibility errors (including GTK-related ones),
> it is recommended to download the `.AppImage` file.
> It will take up more space since it includes libraries even if they are already installed on your system.
